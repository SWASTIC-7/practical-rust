# Introduction

Rust is very modern and popular language. It is famous for its memory safety,control,speed and many more. Meanwhile It has lots of syntactical machineries to deal with hence making it difficult to learn.

## Motivation

There are already excellent Rust books out there. So why write another one? (Yes, I'm a bit crazy—and wanted to learn along the way)

Well I want to make this a hands-on book, to make it a memorable practice so that we don't face difficulty while writting and thinking in Rust.

## Who this book is for?

Well this book is for someone who knows the syntaxes of different topics , had tried going through rust-book through ways, but still not able to write the code themselves.

Well my suggestion if you are an absolute begginer:
- Go through easy-rust to learn syntaxes and concepts
- Then solve Rust-by-example for more basic understanding
- meanwhile you can also refer to rust-docs
- then come to this book
