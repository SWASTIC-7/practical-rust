# Introduction

Rust is a very modern and popular language. It is famous for its memory safety, control, speed, and many more things.  
At the same time, it comes with a lot of syntactical machinery to deal with, which often makes it difficult to learn and even harder to apply in real-world code.

Many people understand Rust concepts while reading, but freeze when they actually try to write something on their own.

This book exists for that exact gap.


## Motivation

There are already excellent Rust books out there.  
So why write another one?  
(Yes, I’m a bit crazy — and I also wanted to learn along the way.)

The idea behind this book is not to teach Rust syntax again, but to make Rust **stick**.

I want this to be a hands-on, example-driven book, where learning feels more like practice than reading.  
The goal is to make Rust concepts memorable, so that when you sit down to write real Rust code, you don’t constantly fight the compiler or second-guess every design decision.

This book focuses on:
- learning through real-world analogies
- understanding why Rust pushes you in a certain direction
- building intuition using working examples and failure cases


## Who Is This Book For

This book is for someone who:
- already knows Rust syntax
- has read parts of *The Rust Programming Language*
- understands concepts when reading them
- but still struggles to write Rust code comfortably

If you’ve ever thought:

> “I understand ownership, but I can’t design this API in Rust”

Then this book is for you.



## Who This Book Is *Not* For

If you are an absolute beginner, I strongly recommend going through these resources first:

- **Easy Rust**  
  https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/

- **The Rust Programming Language**  
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

- **Rust by Example**  
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/

- **Official Rust Documentation**  
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/

After that, come back to this book.

This book is written assuming you already know Rust — now you want to think in Rust.


> This book is meant to be played with.  
> Run the examples. Break them. Read compiler errors.  
> Rust teaches best when you interact with it.
